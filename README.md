## Discord-Bot-py-
# A discord bot written in py / supports slash commands


Included are:
- some replit files, since I tend to work on different systems from anywhere (makes running and testing the bot more comfortable and faster)
- a cog file which includes the different ``command.py`` files, because it is more organized that way + a short ``main.py``
- several installations via cmd are required for the imports to work -> installation via ``pip``

Not included but required:
- a python file named ``config`` which says: ``TOKEN = "Your Bot-Token"``

I also made a [discord js bot](https://github.com/Jasonkami/Discord-Bot-js-/tree/main) which currently does not support slash commands.
